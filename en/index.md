<h2>Why green buildings?</h2>

<p>The climate crisis demands immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and develop climate-resilient buildings. <strong>Green buildings</strong> reflect a sustainable and comprehensive approach to improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing their emissions to ensure a healthier environment and future for all Canadians.</p><div class="row wb-eqht wb-init wb-eqht-inited" id="wb-auto-4">

<h2>Green buildings by 2050</h2>

<p>To protect our environment and reduce the impacts of climate change, the Government of Canada has committed to reducing Canada’s total GHG emissions to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2021/04/canadas-enhanced-nationally-determined-contribution.html">40 to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030</a> and to reaching net-zero by 2050. As the <strong>buildings sector is the third-largest source of emissions in Canada</strong>, prioritizing decarbonization, i.e. reducing or ending emissions into the atmosphere, is key to meeting our objectives. However, achieving net-zero emissions in buildings by 2050 will require overcoming several significant challenges.</p><div class="row wb-eqht wb-init">

<h2>Getting there together: The Canada Green Buildings Strategy</h2>

<p>Net-zero GHG emissions in the buildings sector by 2050 is an ambitious goal. <a href="https://budget.gc.ca/2022/home-accueil-en.html">Budget 2022</a> committed $150 million to develop the Canada Green Buildings Strategy.</p>

<p>The strategy will set out measures to accomplish this goal, and actions within the strategy will be sequenced to reduce GHG emissions, create more climate-resilient buildings, increase skilled jobs, and increase investment.</p>

<p>Improving the resilience of buildings to climate risks such as temperature increases, floods and wildfires is essential to actively address and respond to current and future extreme weather events. This also helps ensure that dwellings are appropriate for their local environment and reduce vulnerability for occupants and the economy.</p>

<h2>Programs and funding for green homes and buildings</h2>

<p>Programs to support the decarbonization of Canada’s building sector are already under way. Learn more about programs and funding available for greening homes or commercial, institutional and community buildings.</p>
